CloudLBS Web Application
------------------------------------
Functional Requirements:

1. DONE - Site Landing Page - Has link to log in (existing users) or create an 
   account (new users), as well as space for logos, links, blurbs, etc.
   
2. New User Page - Not GWT. Just a form requesting basic user account info.

3. New User Creation Process:
   a. Person fills out form on New User Page
   b. Basic user account is created in PENDING state
   c. An email is sent to the person with a confirmation link
   d. When they click the confirmation link, account goes to OK state, and 
      user lands on "You're confirmed" page with link to log in.

4. Login Page - Plain-old Spring Security login form with styles.

5. Main App Landing Page (Basic User Account):

   a. Show user's name
   b. Link to log out - returns to Site Landing Page
   c. Link to user Settings (name spelling, password, etc)
   
   d. My Devices:

      This is the list of any devices that the user has ever signed in on
      via any app. It is the exhaustive list of devices that ever provided
      any non-anonymous location data for this user.
      
      Devices can be in two states - Confirmed and Unconfirmed
      
      Unconfirmed devices are those that the user may have signed in on, but
      does not own. These may belong to someone else in the system, or no one
      in the system. The user cannot remotely manage application settings
      on an unconfirmed device.
      
      Confirmed devices are those confirmed as belonging exclusively to the
      user. A device can only be confirmed for a single user. A user may
      remotely manage application settings, among other things, on a 
      confirmed device. See "Confirming a Device," and "Unconfirming a
      Device."
